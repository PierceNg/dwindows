This is a pre-release of Dynamic Windows version 2.1.0.

The current Dynamic Windows source base is stable on
OS/2, Mac, Windows, Linux, FreeBSD and Solaris.

Known problems:

Boxes with no expandable items will have their contents centered on 
    GTK instead of top or left justified on the other platforms.
MDI does not work on GTK3 and is not implemented the same on Mac.
    At this time we cannot recommend using MDI in new code,
    but it will be supported for existing code on OS/2, Win and GTK2.
    If support for MDI improves on GTK3/Mac this status may change.
GTK3 due to changes in the core architecture does not support
    widgets that are smaller than what is contained within them
    unless they use scrolled windows. GTK2 and other platforms do.

Known limitations:

It is not safe on all platforms to operate on widgets before they
are packed.  For portability pack widgets before operating on them.

On Windows a slider control will only work properly if it is the
only slider in a box.  If there is more than one slider control 
in a box then signals may get misdirected to the wrong control.

On Unix (GTK) the window manager border is not a constant value
so environment variables DW_BORDER_WIDTH and DW_BORDER_HEIGHT
are used for proper positioning.

On Mac if performing Dynamic Windows operations on secondary 
threads which do not terminate, it may be required to call
a Mac specific DW function _dw_pool_drain() at the end of the
thread's loop to prevent memory leaks.

Future features:

OS/2 is currently missing the Calendar and HTML widgets because
the system does not support them by default. Looking into writing
custom ones or importing functionality from available libraries.

Changes from version 2.0:
Added support for MacOS 10.7 Lion, version 2.0 had some issues.
Fixed issues with the tree widget on Mac.
Added dw_font_set_default() to set the default text widget font.
Added dw_font_choose() to display a dialog to pick a font.
Added dw_box_pack_at_index() like the other dw_box_pack_*() 
   functions except packing at arbitrary locations is possible.
