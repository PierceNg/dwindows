This is a preview release of Dynamic Windows version 2.3.

The current Dynamic Windows source base is considered stable on:
OS/2, Mac, Windows, Linux, FreeBSD and Solaris.

Known problems:

Boxes with no expandable items will have their contents centered on 
    GTK2 instead of top or left justified on the other platforms.
GTK3 due to changes in the core architecture does not support
    widgets that are smaller than what is contained within them
    unless they use scrolled windows. GTK2 and other platforms do.

Known limitations:

It is not safe on all platforms to operate on widgets before they
are packed.  For portability pack widgets before operating on them.

On Mac if performing Dynamic Windows operations on secondary 
threads which do not terminate, it may be required to call
a Mac specific DW function _dw_pool_drain() at the end of the
thread's loop to prevent memory leaks.

Future features:

OS/2 is currently missing the HTML widget because the system does 
not support it by default. Looking into importing functionality 
from available libraries (Firefox, Webkit, Qt, etc).

Changes from version 2.2:
Added dw_menu_delete_item() for removing menu items.
    Now you can use dw_window_destroy() on menu items handles also.
Added dw_app_dir() which attempts to locate private application data
    for the current platform.
Added dw_window_set_tooltip() for adding tooltips to most widgets.
Added dw_window_get_preferred_size() for getting the size the system
    thinks the widget should be, to aid in creating layouts.
Added support for -1 size parameter to the dw_box_pack*() functions to 
    automatically figure out a suggested size for many controls.
Added automatic window redraw support for OS/2, Windows and Mac.
Added dw_window_set_gravity() for enhanced window placement.
Added DW_GRAV_OBSTACLES support for using system obstacles as gravity
   anchor points on OS/2, Mac and Windows.
Added automatic window border detection on GTK.
   This eliminates the need for the DW_BORDER_* environment variables.
Added Open Watcom compiler support for OS/2.
Added pseudo transparent background widget support on Windows and OS/2.
   If you set the background color of a widget to DW_RGB_TRANSPARENT...
   it will attempt to use the background color of the parent.
   Several types of widgets have this set by default now.
Added faster and less buggy layout engine 2.0 for OS/2, Windows and Mac.
Added auto-positioning on Mac; reimplemented auto-positioning on OS/2.
Fixed auto-sizing top-level windows on Windows; added on OS/2 and Mac.
Fixed bubble help not being displayed on Windows.
Fixed menu bar items remaining highlighted on Mac.
Fixed OS/2 and Windows showing windows during dw_window_set_pos/size().
Deprecated DW_FCF_NOBYTEALIGN and DW_FCF_SHELLPOSITION flags.
