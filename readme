This is an alpha release of dynamic windows version 0.5.0.

The current Dynamic Windows source base is relatively stable on
OS/2, Windows, Linux, FreeBSD and Solaris.  Although not all functionality
has been thoroughly tested.  When a feature set has been decided on for
the 1.0 I will freeze the API and move into beta stage.  When the beta
feature set is stable I will release a final.

Known problems:

Splitbars don't always calculate properly on OS/2.
Splitbars are not implemented on Unix and only partially implemented
    on Windows.
Boxes don't adhere to ratios on Unix.

Future features:

Implementing a full set of controls. Most controls common to OS/2, Windows and
GTK have been implemented.  Although not all the functionality of the native 
controls have been integrated into Dynamic Windows.

Documentation, I have all the functions relatively well documented in the 
source code but a developers manual and online API reference will need to
be written.

If you have any questions or suggestions feel free to email me at

Thanks!
