This is a stable release of Dynamic Windows version 2.0.0.

The current Dynamic Windows source base is stable on
OS/2, Windows, Linux, FreeBSD and Solaris.  The Mac (Cocoa)
version appears stable but has not undergone harsh testing.

Known problems:

Boxes don't adhere to ratios on Unix.

Known limitations:

It is not safe on all platforms to operate on widgets before they
are packed.  For portablity pack widgets before operating on them.

On Windows a slider control will only work properly if it is the
only slider in a box.  If there is more than one slider control 
in a box then signals may get misdirected to the wrong control.

On OS/2 and Windows MLE controls scrolled position may get 
corrupted when resizing.

On Unix (GTK) the window manager border is not a constant value
so environment variables DW_BORDER_WIDTH and DW_BORDER_HEIGHT
are used for proper positioning.

On Mac if performing Dynamic Windows operations on secondary 
threads which do not terminate, it may be required to call
a Mac specific DW function _dw_pool_drain() at the end of the
thread's loop to prevent memory leaks.

Future features:

OS/2 is currently missing the Calendar and HTML widgets because
the system does not support them by default. Looking into writing
custom ones or importing functionality from available libraries.
