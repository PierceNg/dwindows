This is an alpha release of dynamic windows.

Currently it is not quite complete and some functionality is broken.

Known problems:

Groupboxes are broken.
Splitbars are based on the original position not the current position,
    and don't update until a resize.

Future features:

Implementing all of the OS/2 controls. Currently a number of controls have not been implemented.
Implementing a toolbar.

If you have any questions or suggestions feel free to email me at dbsoft@technologist.com

Thanks!

Brian Smith
