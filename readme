This is a preview release of Dynamic Windows version 2.3.

The current Dynamic Windows source base is considered stable on:
OS/2, Mac, Windows, Linux, FreeBSD and Solaris.

Known problems:

Boxes with no expandable items will have their contents centered on 
    GTK2 instead of top or left justified on the other platforms.
GTK3 due to changes in the core architecture does not support
    widgets that are smaller than what is contained within them
    unless they use scrolled windows. GTK2 and other platforms do.

Known limitations:

It is not safe on all platforms to operate on widgets before they
are packed.  For portability pack widgets before operating on them.

On Unix (GTK) the window manager border is not a constant value
so environment variables DW_BORDER_WIDTH and DW_BORDER_HEIGHT
are used for proper positioning.

On Mac if performing Dynamic Windows operations on secondary 
threads which do not terminate, it may be required to call
a Mac specific DW function _dw_pool_drain() at the end of the
thread's loop to prevent memory leaks.

Future features:

OS/2 is currently missing the HTML widget because the system does 
not support it by default. Looking into importing functionality 
from available libraries (Firefox, Webkit, Qt, etc).

Changes from version 2.2:
Added dw_menu_delete_item() for removing menu items.
    Now you can use dw_window_destroy() on menu items handles also.
Added dw_app_dir() which attempts to locate private application data
    for the current platform.
Added dw_window_set_tooltip() for adding tooltips to most widgets.
Added support for -1 size parameter to the dw_box_pack*() functions to 
    automatically figure out a suggested size for many controls.
Fixed bubble help not being displayed on Windows.
Fixed menu bar items remaining highlighted on Mac.
