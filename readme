This is an alpha release of dynamic windows version 0.5.0.

The current Dynamic Windows source base is relatively stable on
OS/2, Windows, Linux, FreeBSD and Solaris.  Although not all functionality
has been thoroughly tested.  When a feature set has been decided on for
the 1.0 I will freeze the API and move into beta stage.  When the beta
feature set is stable I will release a final.

Known problems:

Splitbars don't always calculate properly on OS/2.
Splitbars are not implemented on Unix and only partially implemented
    on Windows.
Boxes don't adhere to ratios on Unix.

Known limitations:

It is not safe all all platforms to operate on widgets before they
are packed.  For portablity pack widgets before operating on them.

On Windows a slider control will only work properly if it is the
only slider in a box.  If there is more than one slider control 
in a box then signals may get misdirected to the wrong control.

On OS/2 slider controls will be misplaced if their postition is
set before showing the window.  The resizing that occurs when
showing the window invalidates the position. 

On OS/2 and Windows MLE controls scrolled position may get 
corrupted when resizing.

On Unix the window manager border is not a constant value so
environment variables DW_BORDER_WIDTH and DW_BORDER_HEIGHT
are ysed for proper positioning.

Future features:

Implementing a full set of controls. Most controls common to OS/2, Windows and
GTK have been implemented.  Although not all the functionality of the native 
controls have been integrated into Dynamic Windows.

Documentation, I have all the functions relatively well documented in the 
source code but a developers manual and online API reference will need to
be written.
